# LASER SECURITY: An Arduino Project
LaserSec: A security module using Arduino which receives SMS as commands and sends SMS as alerts when the laser that hits the light-sensitive module is interrupted.

# Introduction
**Light Amplification by Simulated Emission of
Radiation.** - A device that generates an intense beam of coherent
monochromatic light. This project utilizes a continuous LASER
beam pointed towards a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to
determine if an area has not been trespassed. A piezo-buzzer
generates noisy tones to indicate that the LASER in contact with
the LDR has been interrupted. A SIM800L GSM Module pushes
notifications via text and can receive commands to activate or
deactivate features of the security system. An LCD constantly
shows status messages of the systemâ€™s current state and actions
successfully done from SMS commands.

Please see the `Technical-Paper.pdf` file for more information such as wiring diagrams, flowcharts, and related discussions. 

The `arduino-sketch.ino` contains the source code that may be imported to the Arduino IDE.
